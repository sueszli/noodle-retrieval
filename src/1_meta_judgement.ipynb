      "DOC: rob_FT943-6570 - ft 29 aug 94 / bankers worship the new orthodoxy : unemployment is not their problem by george graham jackson hole , wyoming central bankers from 19 countries gathered this weekend at the invitation of the federal reserve bank of kansas city in the shadow of the grand teton mountains to discuss unemployment , and came away with a reassuring message : it is not their problem . a bevy of academic economists agreed that most of the high unemployment rates in industrialised countries was attributable to structural factors - principally , the way the welfare state distorts an unemployed person ' s incentive to work - and not to the cyclical , demand factors which are within a central bank ' s power to influence . heads nodded piously in the audience as professor paul krugman of stanford university said that it was now all but universally accepted among academic economists , though still suspect to politicians and journalists , that there was a ' natural ' rate of unemployment . a central bank could expand demand and push the actual rate of unemployment below this level , but only at the expense of accelerating inflation . professor krugman argued that there was a technology - driven trend towards inequality that europe ' s generous welfare systems turned into lower employment and the us ' s more flexible labour markets allowed to pass into widening income gaps . although professor charles bean of the london school of economics argued that a central bank could actually help to lower this natural rate by allowing a slight degree of additional inflation to accompany structural reforms , the overwhelming view was that monetary policy could influence only the short term rate of unemployment ; in the long run , unemployment would tend to converge on its natural rate . ' where employment is concerned , in the short run , macroeconomics is everything , and in the long run , macroeconomics is nothing , ' concluded mr alan blinder , once an academic economist himself but now the new vice - chairman of the federal reserve board . this is music to the ears of most central bankers , who have long been defending themselves against the accusation that they are buying lower inflation at the expense of higher unemployment . ' i am very happy with this general theme of the long run absence of any trade - off between inflation and unemployment , ' said one senior fed official . another added : ' not only is there no unemployment / inflation trade - off , but there are positive gains for employment from a low inflation environment . ' the natural unemployment rate theory has precise implications for us monetary policy , for although fed officials are not as precise in their estimate of this rate as professor edmund phelps of columbia university - who estimates it at around 6\n",

      "DOC: trip_10424257 - \"\"\" \"\" \"\" liver transplantation in patients with liver failure related to exertional heatstroke . background & aims : severe acute liver injury is a grave complication of exertional heatstroke . liver transplantation ( lt ) may be a therapeutic option , but the criteria for lt and the optimal timing of lt have not been clearly established . the aim of this study was to define the profile of patients who require transplantation in this context . methods : this was a multicentre , retrospective study of patients admitted with a diagnosis of exertional heatstroke - related severe acute liver injury with a prothrombin time ( pt ) of less than 50 % . a total of 24 male patients were studied . results : fifteen of the 24 patients ( median nadir pt : 35 % [ 29 . 5 - 40 . 5 ] ) improved under medical therapy alone and survived . nine of the 24 were listed for emergency lt . at the time of registration , the median pt was 10 % ( 5 - 12 ) and all had numerous dysfunctional organs . five patients ( nadir pt : 12 % [ 9 - 12 ] ) were withdrawn from the list because of an elevation of pt values that mainly occurred between day 2 and day 3 . ultimately , 4 patients underwent transplantation as their pt persisted at < 10 % , 3 days ( 2 . 75 - 3 . 25 ) after the onset of exertional heatstroke , and they had more than 3 organ dysfunctions . of these 4 patients , 3 were still alive 1 year later . histological analysis of the 4 explanted livers demonstrated massive or sub - massive necrosis , and little potential for effective mitoses , characterised by a \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" mitonecrotic \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" appearance . conclusion : the first - line treatment for exertional heatstroke - related severe acute liver injury is medical therapy . lt is only a rare alternative and such a decision should not be taken too hastily . a persistence of pt < 10 % , without any signs of elevation after a median period of 3 days following the onset of heatstroke , was the trigger that prompted lt , was the trigger adopted in order to decide upon lt . lay summary : acute liver injury due to heatstroke can progress to acute liver failure with organ dysfunction despite medical treatment ; in such situations , liver transplantation ( lt ) may offer a therapeutic option . the classic criteria for lt appear to be poorly adapted to heatstroke - related acute liver failure . we confirmed thatmedication\"\n",

      "DOC: trip_1070796 - long - term prognosis for transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver failure . background : the prognosis for transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver failure remains unknown . aim : to examine whether paracetamol - induced acute liver failure increases long - term mortality . methods : we followed up all transplant - free survivors of paracetamol - induced acute liver injury , hospitalized in a danish national referral centre during 1984 - 2004 . we compared age - specific mortality rates from 1 year post - discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not . results : we included 641 patients . on average , age - specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol - induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure ( adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1 . 70 , 95 % ci 1 . 02 - 2 . 85 ) , but the association was age - dependent , and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease , whereas suicides were frequent in both groups . these observations speak against long - term effects of acute liver failure . more likely , the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure . conclusions : paracetamol - induced acute liver failure did not affect long - term mortality . clinical follow - up may be justified by the cause of the liver failure , but not by the liver failure itself . 2010 blackwell publishing ltd .\n",
